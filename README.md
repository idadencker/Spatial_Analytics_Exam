# Spatial Analytics Exam 2024: Comparative Analysis of Public Playground Access in Four Danish Municipalities


## Introduction
This repository contains code and data for the project: Comparative Analysis of Public Playground Access in Four Danish Municipalities. <br>
This project will investigate the accessibility of public playgrounds for four different Danish municipalities: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Ringk√∏bing-Skjern and Vesthimmerland. Accessibility will be assessed by calculating playgrounds per family with children in the age of 0-12 years old, as well as the percentage of the municipal area that is within a 15-minute walking distance from a public playground, visualised as isochrone maps, to determine if any differences across the four municipalities exist.


## Repository overview 
The repository consists of:
- Playgrounds_map_files folder: created when running the R markdown for visualsing the Leaflet map
- data folder: contains playgrounds data for the four municipalities, municipalities border data and the families data csv loaded via statistikbanken.dk
